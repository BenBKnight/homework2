This was a challenging project. 
I had issues trying to incorperate items from bootstrap. I felt like I spent more time understanding their code and changing it, than I would have writing my own. This applies to somethings, but definitely not everything. 
The most challenging parts for me were the things that were responsive. The header going from covering the entire top page to sharing with the navigation bar was semi-challenging. I was writing for a small screen first, then tried scaling up.
The footer was also a challenge. I'm sure there was an easier way, but I had to add a few extra lines of code to make sure it was always in the right spot, depending on how long the page was. 
I had issues with bootstrap's "card" components, trying to get my portfolio pictures to look correct. I ended up at ww3schools and found their code/design was a lot easier to grasp.
